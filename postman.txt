Part 2

Check if the POST request accepts params, queries, and/or a body. Which one(s) and what information is it expecting to be sent?
POST requires a body that includes the “text” field

What data type does the GET request return?
GET returns objects from the api

What would the URL look like for deleting the post with the id 555? (This post does not exist anymore, but the syntax is the same for existing posts, )
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=555

List the possible response codes from the GET request at ‘/posts/filter’
The only response for GET is 200

Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=John

What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your favorite color instead of your name?
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts?id=1571
{
	“Text”: “Blue”
}

What is the URL to get posts that contain the text “blue”?
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=blue

Make a request to GET all the posts. What is the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)
Content type: application/json 
Charset: utf-8

What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?
Request was missing req.query.id or req.body.text

What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
It gets all the objects.  Because it does not accept query parameters, it ignores any that may be present.
